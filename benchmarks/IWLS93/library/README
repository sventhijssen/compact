The LGSynth93/lib directory contains the target library definition
data. There are three files that can be used to get information about
target cells.


iwls93.e
	This is an edif format netlist that contains one cell for
	each of the target technology cells.  Each such cells contains
	a valid logic model defined in terms of generic logic gates.
	Each view is annotated with an area property, each input
	pin with a cap property and each output with a maxcap property.

	This file currently lacks timing data.


iwls93.models
	This is a complete model file containing an area property, pin
	properties (cap and maxcap), a logic model, and timing data.
	This format has the advantage over the previous distribution formats
	in that it can represent multi-output primitives and sequential
	elements.


iwls93.mis2lib
	This file is a misII library for the cells that can be represented
	in the misII format.  It is provided mainly for compatability.
