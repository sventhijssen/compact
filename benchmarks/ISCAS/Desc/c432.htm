<P>Function: </B>c432 is a 27-channel interrupt controller. The input channels 
are grouped into three 9-bit buses (we call them A, B and C), where the bit 
position within each bus determines the interrupt request priority. A forth 
9-bit input bus (called E) enables and disables interrupt requests within the 
respective bit positions. The figure above concisely represents the circuit. The 
figure above contains the modules labeled <A

href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~jhayes/iscas/c432m5.html">M5</A>, which contain 
the underlying logic. </P>
<P>The interrupt controller has three interrupt request buses A, B and C, each 
having nine bits or channels, and one channel-enable bus E. The following 
priority rules apply: A[i] &gt; B[j] &gt; C[k], for any i, j, k; i.e., bus A has 
the highest priority and bus C the lowest. Within each bus, a channel with a 
higher index has priority over one with a lower index; for example, A[i] &gt; 
A[j], if i &gt; j. If E[i] = 0, then the A[i], B[i], and C[i] inputs are 
disregarded.</P>
<P>The seven outputs PA, PB, PC and Chan[3:0] specify which channels have 
acknowledged interrupt requests. Only the channel of highest priority in the 
requesting bus of highest priority is acknowledged. One exception is that if two 
or more interrupts produce requests on the channel that is acknowledged, each 
bus is acknowledged. For example, if A[4], A[2], B[6] and C[4] have requests 
pending, A[4] and C[4] are acknowledged. Module M5 is a 9-line-to-4-line 
priority encoder. The output line numbered 421 actually produces the inverted 
Chan[3] response of that shown in the <A 
href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~jhayes/iscas/c432m5tt.html">truth table</A>. We 
have taken the liberty of adding an inverter to output 421 to form Chan[3] for 
this table (but not in the models).&nbsp;</P><B>
