		    Non-Redundant ISCAS '85 Benchmarks.

This directory contains a modified version of the ISCAS '85 benchmark set.
Although they are functionally equivalent to the original circuits, the 
logic redundancies have been removed by the method described in:

|** <March 4, 1993>  UPDATE: 5 Non-Redundant Benchmark Circuits Corrected **|
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Dr. Wolfgang Kunz of the University of Hanover has brought to our
notice that some of the non-redundant benchmarks earlier made available 
in this directory were not functionally equivalent to their corresponding
original ISCAS85 benchmark circuits. This discrepancy was caused by a bug
in the earlier versions of the redundancy removal software, which caused it
to remove some some non-redundant connections under certain circumstances. 

	A corrected version of the redundancy removal software has since
been developed by Gert-Jan Tromp. The non-redundant benchmark circuits 
which were not functional equivalents of their ISCAS85 counterparts have
been identified and corrected by Dr. Tromp and Dr. Kunz. The functionality
of the corrected versions of the non-redundant benchmark circuits has been
tested using 3.2 million random patterns. 

	A total of five non-redundant benchmarks were modified. These 
are: c1908nr.isc, c2670nr.isc, c3540nr.isc, c5315nr.isc and c7552nr.isc.
The functionally incorrect version of each of these benchmarks has now been
replaced by the corrected version. The earlier (faulty) versions have been
retained for archival/reference purposes, but they have now been renamed 
as follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|Name of  |	   |Corrected version of|	  |Earlier (faulty) version|
|Benchmark|	   |benchmark is in file|	  |of circuit is in file   |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  c1908		c1908nr.isc			c1908nr_old.isc    |
|  c2670	 	c2670nr.isc			c2670nr_old.isc    |
|  c3540	 	c3540nr.isc 			c3540nr_old.isc    |
|  c5315	 	c5315nr.isc 			c5315nr_old.isc    |
|  c7552	 	c7552nr.isc 			c7552nr_old.isc    |

set of ISCAS85 benchmarks, please read the latest Benchmark Newsletter,
